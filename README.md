# Gravado
## Find What You Crave

## Created by: Cole Waggoner, Jarrett Stavey, and Luis Alicea

 Our team's motivation for creating Gravado was to compile all dinner decision-making info into one, easy to use location.
 We wanted to answer the eternal question: "What is for dinner?"
 During the process our team learned a lot about integrating multiple APIs into a page, as well as using the Bulma framework.

## Usage
From the home page, you can use the search bar to input your location, and the type of food you're looking for. Gravado will then provide you with several options for recipes that fit your taste, and restaurants near you.

You can use the NavBar at the top of the screen to navigate to the Recipes, or Restaurants pages. These pages provide search bars that will narrow your results to either category, displaying more of that option per page.
